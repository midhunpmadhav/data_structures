Repo: data_structures
=====================

C++ implementation of common data structures problems and algorithms.

This repository contains solutions for the following problems
=============================================================
a. Tree:
1. Print left view of a binary tree
2. Print right view of a binary tree
3. Print top view of a binary tree
4. Tree traversals - Preorder, inorder and postorder
5. Level(horizondal) order traversal of a binary tree
6. Vertical order traversal of a binary tree

b. Linked List:
1. Reverse a singly linked list (with/without recursion)
2. Reverse a doubly linked list (with/without recursion)
3. Find loop in a singly linked list
4. Find the middle node of a singly linked list
5. Print a pattern (see description in file print_pattern.cpp for more details)

c. Graph:
1. Breadth first search (BFS) using recursion
2. Breadth first search (BFS) using queue
3. Depth first search (DFS) using stack

d. Heap
1. Build max and min heap

e. Queue
1. Implementation of queue  using linked list

f. Stack
1. Implementation of stack using linked list
