Repo: data_structures
=====================

C++ implementation of common data structures problems and algorithms.

This repository contains solutions of following problems
========================================================
a. Tree:
1. Print left view of a binary tree
2. Print right view of a binary tree
3. Print top view of a binary tree
4. Tree traversals - Preorder, inorder and postorder
5. Level(horizondal) order traversal of a binary tree
6. Vertical order traversal of a binary tree

b. Linked List:
1. Reversal of singly linked list (with/without recursion)
1. Reversal of doubly linked list (with/without recursion)

c. Graph:
1. Breadth first search (BFS) using recursion
2. Breadth first search (BFS) using queue
3. Depth first search (DFS) using stack
